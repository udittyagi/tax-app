                                    Private Limited Company is a legal entity and a juristic person 
                                    established under the Companies Act. Hence, a company has a range of 
                                    legal capacities including opening of a bank account, hiring of employees, 
                                    taking on equity or obtaining licenses and more as an independent corporate entity. 
                                    The members (Shareholders/Directors) of a company have no personal 
                                    liability to the creditors of a company for company's debts.

                                    existence until it is legally dissolved. A company being a separate 
                                    legal person, is unaffected by the death or other departure of any member and 
                                    continues to be in existence irrespective of the changes in ownership.
