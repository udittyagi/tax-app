Proprietorships are very easy to start and have very minimal regulatory compliance requirement for started and operating. However, after the startup phase, proprietorship's do not offer the promoter a host of benefits such as limited liability proprietorship, corporate status, separate legal entity, independent existence, transferability, perpetual existence - which are desirable features for any business. Therefore, proprietorship registration is suited only for unorganized, small businesses that will remain small and/or have a limited period of existence. There is no mechanism provided by the Government of India for the registration of a Proprietorship. Therefore, the existence of a proprietorship must be established through tax registrations and other business registrations that a business is required to have as per the rules and regulations. For instance, GST Registration can be obtained in the name of the Proprietor to establish that the Proprietor is operating a business as a sole proprietorship.

Proprietorships are very easy to start \n                            and have very minimal regulatory compliance requirement for started and operating. \n                            However, after the startup phase, proprietorship's do not offer the promoter a \n                            host of benefits such as limited liability proprietorship, corporate status, \n                            separate legal entity, independent existence, transferability, perpetual existence - \n                            which are desirable features for any business. Therefore, proprietorship registration \n                            is suited only for unorganized, small businesses that will \n                            remain small and/or have a limited period of existence. There is no mechanism \n                            provided by the Government of India for the registration of a Proprietorship. \n                            Therefore, the existence of a proprietorship must be established through tax \n                            registrations and other business registrations that a business is required to \n                            have as per the rules and regulations. For instance, GST Registration can be \n                            obtained in the name of the Proprietor to establish that the Proprietor is operating \n                            a business as a sole proprietorship. Thus, all the registrations for a proprietorship \n                            would be in the name of the Proprietor, making the Proprietor personally liable for \n                            all the liabilities of the Proprietorship.\n                            </p>\n                        </article>\n                        <article>\n                            <h2>Benefits of Proprietorship Registration</h2>\n                            <hr></hr>\n                            <ul style={{listStyleType:\"square\"}}>\n                                <li>\n                                    <h3 style={{textAlign: \"left\", textDecoration:\"underline\", fontWeight: \"300\"}}>Easy to Start</h3>\n                                    <p>\n                                    Proprietorship needs minimal registration.

However, after starting \n                                    up a Proprietorship, it is relatively harder to open a bank account or obtain a \n                                    payment gateway in the name of the business - \n                                    since more registrations like GST Registration may be required. \n                                    </p>\n                                </li>\n                                <li>\n                                    <h3 style={{textAlign: \"left\", textDecoration:\"underline\", fontWeight: \"300\"}}>Business Name</h3>\n                                    <p>\n                                    Since the name of a proprietorship is not registered, a proprietorship can \n                                    choose to have any name - as long as it does not infringe on a registered \n                                    trademark.
