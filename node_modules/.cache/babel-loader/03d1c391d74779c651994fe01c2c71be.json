By abolishing and subsuming multiple taxes into a single system, tax complexities would be reduced while tax base is increased substantially. Under the new GST regime, all entities involved in buying or selling goods or providing services or both are required to register for GST. Entities without GST registration would not be allowed to collect GST from a customer or claim input tax credit of GST paid or could be penalised. Further, registration under GST is mandatory once an entity crosses the minimum threshold turnover of starts a new business that is expected to cross the prescribed turnover. As per the GST Council, entities in special category states with an annual turnover of Rs.10 lakhs and above would be required to register under GST. All other entities in rest of India would be required to register for GST if annual turnover exceeds Rs.20 lakhs. There are also various other criteria's, that could make an entity liable for obtaining GST registration - irrespective of annual sales turnover. Entities required to register for GST as per regulations must file for GST application within 30 days from the date on which the entity became liable for registration under GST.

                       GST is the biggest tax reform in India, tremendously improving ease of doing business\n                                and increasing the taxpayer base in India by bringing in millions of small businesses in\n                                India. By abolishing and subsuming multiple taxes into a single system, tax\n                                complexities would be reduced while tax base is increased substantially. Under the\n                                new GST regime, all entities involved in buying or selling goods or providing services or\n                                both are required to register for GST. Entities without GST registration would not be\n                                allowed to collect GST from a customer or claim input tax credit of GST paid or could be\n                                penalised. Further, registration under GST is mandatory once an entity crosses the\n                                minimum threshold turnover of starts a new business that is expected to cross the\n                                prescribed turnover.\n    \n                                As per the GST Council, entities in special category states with an annual turnover of\n                                Rs.10 lakhs and above would be required to register under GST. All other entities in\n                                rest of India would be required to register for GST if annual turnover exceeds Rs.20\n                                lakhs. There are also various other criteria&#39;s, that could make an entity liable for\n                                obtaining GST registration - irrespective of annual sales turnover. Entities required to\n                                register for GST as per regulations must file for GST application within 30 days from the\n                                date on which the entity became liable for registration under GST.\n    \n                                Privy Corporate Consulting is the leading business services platform in India, offering a\n                                variety of services like income tax filing, GST return filing, private limited company\n    \n                                registration, trademark filing and more.

After obtaining GST registration, sometimes a GST \n                            registration may need to be cancelled. Some of the most common reasons for \n                            cancellation of GST registration are closure of business, no requirement \n                            to pay GST, transfer of business, change in constitution and no business \n                            activity. Surrendering a GST registration will reduce the compliance \n                            requirement for the taxpayer, as GST returns would not longer have to \n                            be filed monthly. To cancel a GST registration, application must be \n                            submitted on the GST Common Portal in FORM GST REG-16 along with the required \n                            information. On submission of an application for cancellation of GST registration, \n                            the GST officer is required to verify the application and issue an order in \n                            FORM GST REG-19, within 30 days from the date of application.\n                            </p>\n                        </article>\n                    </div>\n                )\n                break;\n\n            case \"Documents\":\n                MenuDetails = (\n                    <div>\n                        <article>\n                            <h2>Documents Required</h2>\n                            <hr></hr>\n                            <ul style={{ listStyleType: \"square\" }}>\n                                <li>\n                                    <h3 style={{ textAlign: \"left\", textDecoration: \"underline\", fontWeight: \"300\" }}>PAN Card of the Business or Applicant</h3>\n                                    <p>\n                                        GSTIN is linked to the PAN of the business.
